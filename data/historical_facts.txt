Q: Who was the first president of the United States?
A: George Washington, the man who couldn't tell a lie but could apparently own slaves without moral qualms. He set the precedent of a two-term limit by stepping down, which was respected until FDR decided four terms sounded better. Congress eventually had to make the two-term thing official with the 22nd Amendment.

Q: What caused World War I?
A: The assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the match, but the powder keg was a mess of entangled alliances, imperial competition, militarism, and nationalism. Essentially, Europe was a room full of heavily armed countries with grudges just waiting for an excuse to start shooting. The archduke's assassination was basically history saying "hold my beer."

Q: When did the Roman Empire fall?
A: Depends who you ask. Western Rome fell in 476 CE when Germanic leader Odoacer deposed Emperor Romulus Augustulus, but the Eastern Byzantine Empire kept the Roman flame burning until Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453. So Rome's fall was less an event and more a millennium-long process, like history's slowest train wreck.

Q: What was the Renaissance?
A: The Renaissance was Europe's cultural glow-up after the Medieval period, spanning roughly the 14th to 17th centuries. It was characterized by renewed interest in classical learning, scientific inquiry, artistic innovation, and people finally bathing regularly again. Think of it as Europe rediscovering the classics and saying, "Hey, maybe we should try thinking again."

Q: Who was Genghis Khan?
A: Genghis Khan was the founder of the Mongol Empire, history's largest contiguous land empire, and possibly the most successful reproductive strategist ever (genetic studies suggest about 1 in 200 men worldwide are his direct descendants). He united nomadic tribes and conquered most of Eurasia through brilliant military tactics and the innovative approach of giving enemies one chance to surrender before unleashing unprecedented devastation.

Q: What was the Industrial Revolution?
A: The Industrial Revolution was humanity's transition from handcrafting items at home while surrounded by family to making them in factories while surrounded by dangerous machinery and child labor. Starting in Britain around 1760, it brought us steam power, mechanization, and a completely new economic system that eventually delivered both unprecedented prosperity and unprecedented pollution.

Q: Who was Joan of Arc?
A: Joan of Arc was a teenage French peasant who claimed divine voices told her to lead France's army against English invaders during the Hundred Years' War. Remarkably, the French king gave her an army, and even more remarkably, she won several crucial battles. Her reward? Being burned at the stake for heresy at age 19. She was later canonized as a saint, which was France's way of saying "our bad" a few centuries too late.

Q: What was the Cold War?
A: The Cold War was a four-decade global staring contest between the United States and Soviet Union after World War II. Rather than fighting directly, they engaged in proxy wars, nuclear brinkmanship, and spending absurd amounts on weapons while claiming moral superiority over each other. It ended when the Soviet Union's economy collapsed, proving that bankruptcy is sometimes preferable to mutual assured destruction.

Q: Who built the pyramids of Egypt?
A: Contrary to what your weird uncle believes, the Egyptian pyramids were built by skilled paid laborers, not slaves or aliens. These workers were farmers who worked on the pyramids during the Nile's annual flood when their fields were underwater. The Great Pyramid of Giza took about 20 years to build around 2560 BCE, using simple machines like ramps and levers to move massive stones with remarkable precision.

Q: What was the Silk Road?
A: The Silk Road was history's most ambitious trade route, connecting China to Europe across 4,000 miles of deserts, mountains, and steppes. Operational from around 130 BCE until the 1450s CE, it wasn't a single road but a network of routes where goods, technologies, religions, and diseases were exchanged. It was basically globalization version 1.0, showing that humans will brave incredible dangers if there's profit to be made.

Q: What caused the French Revolution?
A: A perfect storm of an absolutist monarchy, a financial crisis from helping American revolutionaries, food shortages, Enlightenment ideas about equality, and a tone-deaf aristocracy. When bread prices skyrocketed and Queen Marie Antoinette allegedly said "let them eat cake" (she didn't actually say this), the peasants decided heads should roll—literally, as it turned out, with the invention of the guillotine.

Q: Who was Leonardo da Vinci?
A: Leonardo da Vinci was the original Renaissance man—painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, botanist, and writer. He painted the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper while also designing flying machines and anatomically dissecting corpses. Today we'd diagnose him with severe ADHD, but in 15th century Italy, they just called him a genius.

Q: What was the Black Death?
A: The Black Death was the greatest pandemic in human history, killing 75-200 million people across Eurasia in the 14th century—up to 60% of Europe's population. Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and spread by fleas on rats, it traveled along trade routes, demonstrating the downside of globalization. The upside? Labor shortages afterward improved working conditions and wages for survivors. Silver linings, I guess.

Q: How did the American Civil War start?
A: With Southern states seceding after Lincoln's election because they feared he would restrict the expansion of slavery, which they considered essential to their economy and society. The actual fighting began when Confederate forces fired on Union-held Fort Sumter in South Carolina in April 1861. Despite revisionist claims about "states' rights," primary sources from Confederate leaders make it abundantly clear that preserving slavery was their main motivation.

Q: Who was Cleopatra?
A: Cleopatra VII was the last active ruler of the Ptolemaic Kingdom of Egypt and far more than just Elizabeth Taylor in heavy eyeliner. She was a brilliant strategist who spoke nine languages, had herself delivered to Julius Caesar rolled in a carpet, and formed political alliances (and children) with both Caesar and Mark Antony. When Rome finally defeated her, she chose suicide by asp rather than surrender.

Q: What was colonialism?
A: Colonialism was European powers' practice of acquiring territories abroad to exploit resources, establish settlements, and expand their empires from the 15th through 20th centuries. While colonizers brought technological innovations and infrastructure, these came with enslavement, resource extraction, cultural destruction, and arbitrary borders that still cause conflicts today. It was basically a global real estate grab backed by superior weaponry and self-serving justifications.

Q: Who was Mahatma Gandhi?
A: Mohandas "Mahatma" Gandhi was the Indian lawyer-turned-independence leader who pioneered nonviolent civil disobedience to drive British colonizers out of India. His tactics of peaceful resistance, mass non-cooperation, and moral authority proved remarkably effective against an empire, inspiring later civil rights movements worldwide. However, his personal life and some of his views were considerably more complicated than the saintly image often portrayed.

Q: What happened during the Cultural Revolution in China?
A: The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) was Chairman Mao's decade-long attempt to reassert control by mobilizing Chinese youth against "old ideas." It devolved into chaotic persecution of intellectuals, destruction of historical artifacts, and violent factional struggles that killed up to 2 million people and disrupted China's economy and education system for a generation. It was essentially a nationwide political purge disguised as revolutionary zeal.

Q: What was the Space Race?
A: The Space Race was the Cold War competition between the US and USSR to achieve firsts in spaceflight capability, serving as a proxy for missile technology development and national prestige. The Soviets launched the first satellite (Sputnik) and human (Gagarin) into space, while the Americans landed the first humans on the Moon. It was geopolitical rivalry masquerading as scientific exploration, though it did accelerate aerospace technology by decades.

Q: Who was Julius Caesar?
A: Julius Caesar was the Roman general and statesman who transformed Rome from a republic to an empire through military conquest, political maneuvering, and crossing the Rubicon river with his army (the ancient equivalent of saying "hold my beer, I'm about to do something unconstitutional"). His reward for his ambition? Being stabbed 23 times by his colleagues on the Ides of March, proving that workplace politics has always been brutal.
